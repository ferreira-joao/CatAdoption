The application will list Cats available for adoption. Mockapi.io was used to provide the Endpoints.

git clone https://github.com/ferreira-joao/CatAdoption.git

cd CatAdoption
```

yarn dev
```
Acess the localhost on your browser:

## Observations
This is my first React Js project in a long time, so it may feel a little unpolished.
